        <li>my topic is about data protection</li>
        <li>will start with my motivation for this topic</li>
        <li>some questions I ask myself: (questions on slide)</li>
        <li>digged into that topic and found out: -> next slide</li>

    <p>More than half of all websites use trackers</p>
    <p>There is not much one can do against it</p>
    <p>Modern tracking mechanisms are really good and act almost invisible</p>

      <h4>1:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>study investigated 100k of websites</li>
        <li>
          separated it into a group of websites, that are privacy critical (health care, banking,
          porn, ...)
        </li>
        <li>and group that is less privacy critical</li>
        <li>
          -> found out, that on critical 60% contain trackers and on less critical 90% contain
          trackers
        </li>
        <li>
          also they found out, that there are only a few companies who provide trackers on these
          websites:
        </li>
        <li>like Google or Facebook ...</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>avoid tracking is really difficult</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are multiple ways a website can track you, they can use on of the ways or all in
          combination
        </li>
        <li>Will give a short intro on the next slide</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>IP tracking:</b> unique number to identify where the user is located</li>
        <li>
          <b>Cookies:</b> File, websites store on a users computer. It usually contains some information
          about the users preferences and there activities. For example when online shopping, the article
          numbers of the users shopping cart can be stored in a cookie and you don't loos the articles
          when closing the browser
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fingerprinting:</b> A unique identifier is created based on the attributes, that can be
          obtained when navigating to a website: These include the operating system, screen size, language
          settings, IP address, installed browser plugins, and many more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tracking pixels:</b> (or web beacon) small image file that is loaded when you open a webpage
          or email containing it. Here the focus is not about the image itself, its mostly hidden for
          the user, but the process of loading it. Because when you open a email and the tracking pixel
          image is loaded from a remote server the sender of the email knows, that you looked at the
          email. Spammers can integrate tracking pixels in their spam mails to find out if a mail address
          is valid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cross-website tracking:</b> This answers the question of "how can advertisers know what
          I like?" -> User visits website A and looks at shoes -> website A sends back a cookie with
          a unique ID -> user navigates some time later to website B -> website B can read the cookie
          from website A and see that the user is interested in shoes -> so they can show advertisement
          about shoes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>My thoughts:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>For me this is pretty scary and concerning</li>
        <li>Thats why I wanna do a project with that topic</li>
        <li>
          There are already really good websites that educate about this topic, so I wanted to take
          another approach
        </li>
        <li>I want to combine this information sharing with art</li>
        <li>the way I wanna do it is with music (cause I'm interested in doing music)</li>
        <li>I want to focus on one of the methods -> Browser Fingerprinting</li>
        <li>
          because it is the most sneaky one and the most difficult one to protect yourself from
        </li>
        <li>with the browser fingerprint we get a lot of different attributes</li>
        <li>and I want to use these attributes to create music</li>
        <li>
          so in other words I will create a unique sound for everyone visiting my project based on
          their browser fingerprint
        </li>
        <li>
          I think it is pretty matching to the topic because the BF is something really in the
          background, something hidden and I want to make it loud and experienceable
        </li>
        <li>so I come to my Title so far:</li>
