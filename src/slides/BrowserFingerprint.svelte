        Collection of all/some/relevant feature information from the browser

        Studies show, that most of the fingerprints are unique and relatively stable throughout a
        period of half a year

        <b>Usage:</b> Tracking tool, but also for web security

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Different studies use a different ammount of attributes</p>
      <p>
        Also some attributes change over time, so it does not make sense to use them in the
        fingerprint. -> We want to be able to identify a user later.
      </p>
      <p>In facte there are studies who test the stability of the FP</p>
      <p>When it comes to usage, it is not only abused for tracking</p>
      <p>Can also increase security on banking websites and detect bots...</p>
